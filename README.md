# KakwaFont

Another 12px monospace bitmap font.

## Presentation

KakwaFont is a 12px monospace bitmap font based on [Terminus](http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/).

I found Terminus too wide, so I have changed most glyphs in order to have thin and clearly seperated characters.

I tried to make a clear difference between "(" and "{", "1" and "l", "0" and "O"...

The result is a clear font, well suited for programming and terminal.
